The pipeline seems to work well for the given images. However, my implementation does not solve the general problem of finding the clearance between people and the walls in a hallway. It is meant specifically for this exact hallway. I think that the task would have been much easier if I was given RGB images, as YOLO could be used to identify the location of the person. This would also fix the edge case of the person being very close to the walls. The current implementation relies on contour detection and would likely combine the person with the wall in this edge case.
